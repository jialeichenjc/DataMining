# DataMining

## Why This Project
Some utility functions for data mining in Java to demonstrate what is going on under the surface

## Why Java
When I took the course of data mining at grad school, I was given full autonomy to choose any language to use. 
I wanted to implement some features from scratch to fully understand the theory behind. In practice, these implentations
often come for free (and I bet with better performance) in common ML or data processing packages. 

## Main Content
K-grams, document hashing, clustering and more

## Note
This project was completed kind of in a rush, with assignment deadlines following me like ghosts in my
second year of grad school. Though it's not an excuse to not code in best practices, this project is not
for reference of good java programming :)
